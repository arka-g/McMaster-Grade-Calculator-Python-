McMaster-Grade-Calculator-Python-
=================================

Keep track of your grades in a .txt file and this program will automatically calculate the correct GPA (12.0 scale). 
It reads the file for the number of units the course has and the mark received. 
The text file can be edited to add/ remove courses and change marks.

This program was coded in python and I made it because I wanted a program to store my grades and calculate my GPA easily.
